# CTF/Challenge Writeups 

This is a Capture The Flag (CTF) writeups repository.
I have done many ctfs but really not great at documenting them.
Usually it involves notepad while jotting down only notes I'd understand :D
There aren't many writeups on here now.. just a couple that i could find from
my earlier days along with some of the recent ones. I'm going to try to update 
this more and add new ones soon.
I'll be using this space to document my process, techniques, and takeaways from challenges I’ve completed on:
