## BACKGROUND

Reviewing the alerts in your network environment, you find indicators that a host within your environment has been infected with malware..

## SCENARIO

LAN segment details:

    LAN segment range:  172.17.0[.]0/24 (172.17.0[.]0 through 172.17.0[.]255)
    Domain:  bepositive[.]com
    Active Directory (AD) domain controller:  172.17.0[.]17 - WIN-CTL9XBQ9Y19
    AD environment name:  BEPOSITIVE
    LAN segment gateway:  172.17.0[.]1
    LAN segment broadcast address:  172.17.0[.]255

## TASK

    Write an incident report based on malicious network activity from the pcap and from the alerts.

    The incident report should contains 3 sections:

        Executive Summary: State in simple, direct terms what happened (when, who, what).
        Victim Details: Details of the victim (hostname, IP address, MAC address, Windows user account name).
        Indicators of Compromise (IOCs): IP addresses, domains and URLs associated with the activity.  SHA256 hashes if any malware binaries can be extracted from the pcap.
