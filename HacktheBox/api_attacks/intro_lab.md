Inlanefreight E-Commerce Marketplace


Inlanefreight has developed a multi-tenant web API that employs Role-based Access Control (RBAC) as its access control policy.

Our objective is to report any vulnerabilities found to the admin of Inlanefreight E-Commerce Marketplace.


The web API can be accessed via a Swagger UI at the /swagger path 

Question:
Interact with any endpoint and inspect the response headers; what is the name of the server that the web API uses?
