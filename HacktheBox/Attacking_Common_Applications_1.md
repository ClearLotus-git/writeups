# Attacking Common Applications - Skills Assessment I

## Objective

During a penetration test against the company Inlanefreight, you have performed extensive enumeration and 
found the network to be quite locked down and well-hardened. You come across one host of particular interest that may be your 
ticket to an initial foothold. Enumerate the target host for potentially vulnerable applications, 
obtain a foothold, and submit the contents of the flag.txt file to complete this portion of the skills assessment.

### Questions

1.  What vulnerable application is running?
2.  What port is this application running on?
3.  What version of the application is in use?
4.  Exploit the application to obtain a shell and submit the contents of the flag.txt file on the Administrator desktop.
