# 04 â€“ Azure 101

**Challenge:** Answer cloud-based questions by exploring a simulated Azure portal.

**Steps I Took:**
- Navigated the Azure-style interface to locate subscription details and user settings.
- Looked through the list of virtual machines and resource groups to find key answers.
- Explored IAM roles and found which users had access to specific services.

**Result:** Each answer was validated in real time. Once all were correct, I got the success message.

**Lesson Learned:** Cloud dashboards can be overwhelming, but knowing where to look makes a big difference.
