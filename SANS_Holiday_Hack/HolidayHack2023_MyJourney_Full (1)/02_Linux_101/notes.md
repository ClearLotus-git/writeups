# 02 â€“ Linux 101

**Challenge:** Navigate a Linux terminal to answer basic questions using standard commands.

**Steps I Took:**
- I used `ls`, `cd`, and `cat` to explore the filesystem and answer the given questions.
- Commands like `whoami`, `pwd`, and `echo $PATH` helped me grab the needed info.
- One question asked for a file's content; I used `cat` on the correct file path to read it.

**Result:** After submitting the correct answers, the system verified the completion of this mini quiz.

**Lesson Learned:** Reinforced Linux fundamentals. Good reminder of how powerful simple terminal navigation is.
