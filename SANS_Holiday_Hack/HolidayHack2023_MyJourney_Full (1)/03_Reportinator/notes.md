# 03 â€“ Reportinator

**Challenge:** Analyze multiple logs and compile a summarized incident report.

**Steps I Took:**
- I downloaded a set of logs and skimmed through for patterns and suspicious activity.
- Focused on entries with failed logins, odd IP addresses, and time anomalies.
- Drafted a brief report using the web form summarizing what the attacker did and how.

**Result:** Once submitted, the system checked the key elements in the report and marked the challenge as done.

**Lesson Learned:** Log triage and summarization is a critical skill. Filtering for what's important saves time.
