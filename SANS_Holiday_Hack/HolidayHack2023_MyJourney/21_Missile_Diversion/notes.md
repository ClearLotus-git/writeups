# OBJECTIVE 22 - Missile Diversion

---

## Challenge:  
Reconfigure a satellite's missile system so that it targets the sun instead of Earth, thwarting Jack's plan on Space Island.

---

## Steps I Took:

**Step 1:**  
Connected to the NanoSat MO Base Station Tool and explored the Action and Parameter Service tabs. I found a debug field that accepted SQL input, indicating a potential SQL injection vulnerability.

**Step 2:**  
Tested various SQL injection strings through the Debug parameter, confirming the vulnerability and enumerating the database. I discovered multiple useful tables, including `pointing_mode`, which controls the missile's target.

**Step 3:**  
Found a serialized Java object in the `satellite_query` table and retrieved the associated parsing code. I reverse-engineered the structure and built a custom Java serializer that generated a valid payload to change the `numerical_mode` in `pointing_mode` from `0` (Earth) to `1` (Sun).

**Step 4:**  
Injected the hex-encoded serialized object via SQL, inserting it into the `satellite_query` table using an `INSERT` command. This successfully triggered the update and redirected the missile.

## Result:  
The missile was redirected away from Earth and safely pointed toward the Sun, completing the challenge.

## Lesson Learned:  
This challenge taught me how dangerous insecure deserialization and SQL injection can beâ€”especially when combined. It also reinforced how important it is to isolate debugging tools and sanitize user input in production environments.
