# BONUS! Fishing Mastery

---

## Challenge:  
Catch one of each fish species across Geese Islands, including the rare *Piscis Cyberneticus Skodo*, and report your findings to Poinsettia McMittens.

---

## Steps I Took:

**Step 1:**  
Discovered a hidden developer reference in the game’s HTML that pointed to `fishdensityref.html`, which contained heatmaps for all 171 fish species and where to find them.

**Step 2:**  
Analyzed the page's JavaScript and identified key functions and button actions for casting, detecting fish bites, and reeling in. I used ChatGPT to create a JavaScript loop that automated the entire fishing process using `simulateFishing(iterations)`.

**Step 3:**  
Used this script to farm for *Piscis Cyberneticus Skodo* near Steampunk Island, then downloaded all fish density maps and asked ChatGPT to write an image overlay script. The result pinpointed the best fishing spot in the game: just off the Blacklight District of Film Noir Island.

**Step 4:**  
Used the optimal fishing spot to catch nearly every fish, then targeted the final missing species using their respective heatmaps until I completed the entire pescadex.

## Result:  
Caught all 171 fish species, including the rare Skodo, and completed the Fishing Mastery bonus objective.

## Lesson Learned:  
Automating repetitive gameplay tasks with browser scripting and visual data overlay can dramatically reduce manual effort—and can even make fishing fun.
