# OBJECTIVE 20 - Space Island Door Speaker  


## OBJECTIVE  
There's a door that needs opening on Space Island! Talk to Jewel Loggins there for more information.

## Hints

The Access Speaker is programmed to only accept Wombley's voice. Maybe you could get a sample of his voice and use an AI tool to simulate Wombley speaking the passphrase.

## My Approach

To unlock the door on Space Island, I needed to **speak a known passphrase using Wombley’s voice**. This involved a combination of OSINT (gathering audio samples) and AI-based voice synthesis.

### Step 1: Gather Required Materials

From **Objective 19**, I already had the passphrase:

```
And he whispered, 'Now I shall be out of sight;
So through the valley and over the height.'
And he'll silently take his way.
```

From **Objective 16**, I had access to Wombley’s voice sample:  
 `wombleycube_the_enchanted_voyage.mp3`

### Step 2: Use AI Voice Cloning Tools

I tested one voice cloning platform:

- [**PlayHT**](https://play.ht/)

The tool allowed me to:
1. Upload the sample audio of Wombley
2. Input the passphrase text
3. Generate a synthesized `.wav` file of Wombley speaking the passphrase

---

### Step 3: Play Back the Synthesized Voice

After generating the `.wav` file, I returned to the door interface and played the audio file using my system’s microphone input.

The door recognized Wombley’s synthesized voice and granted access to the restricted area.

## Lessons Learned

AI voice cloning using real user sample be a real pain.
