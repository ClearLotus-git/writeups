# SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2022 â€“ KringleCon V: Golden Rings 

This event was one of my favorites because it was inspired by The Lord of the Rings. Thank you to SANS for doing this event! 
The following will be a solutions-style walkthrough for my journey.. I've always dreamed of a cyber event like it! I was happy 
to eventually find all the rings and save Christmas :) This is my writeup for the Golden Rings Challenge.
